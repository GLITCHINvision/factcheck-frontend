# FactCheck Bot â€“ AI-Powered Real-Time Fact Verification

FactCheck Bot is an AI-powered web chatbot that helps users verify the credibility of information in real time. It intelligently distinguishes between **factual** and **hallucinated** statements using advanced LLMs combined with reliable fact-checking APIs.

---

##  Features

-  **Real-Time Fact Verification**  
  Instantly checks if a statement is factually accurate using external data sources and APIs.

-  **LLM + Verified Mode**  
  Toggle between LLM-generated responses or verified-only responses from credible sources.

-  **Transformer-Powered**  
  Uses models like Bloomz-560m or Falcon via Hugging Face for fast and lightweight response generation.

-  **Hallucination Filtering**  
  Reduces AI hallucinations by cross-verifying data with multiple trusted fact-checking APIs.

-  **Simple & Intuitive UI**  
  Built using React for a clean user experience.
